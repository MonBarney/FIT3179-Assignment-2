            Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita is an important indicator in modern world. It shows the
            economic growth of any given country. 
          </p>

          <p>
            From the map, countries such as Australia, Greenland, Sweden and United States are doing
            much better than any other countries in the world. This is due to them in having high GDP 
            per capita as compared to the other parts of the world.
          </p>

          <p>

          </p>

          <p>
            In contrast, countries in Africa are not doing as well as the rest of the world as they have
            low GDP per capita. This could implies that they are underdeveloped.

            From this interactive scatterplot, we can observed that there might be a positive 
            collearation between Population and Greenhouse Gases Emissions.

            By using the slider provided, we are able to see the changes in the past 20 years. We 
            are able to observe that the greenhouse gases emissions and population increases over
            the years.

          <p>
            Countries in Asia tends to have high population while emitting high amounts of greenhouse
            Gases whereas countries in Oceania have low population and emitting low amounts of 
            greenhouse gases.

            By selecting any continent in the legend provided, we are able to observe the change of

            the rest of the continents.

                This chart shows the amount of greenhouse gases emissions from 2002 to 2019. 
              </p>
                
              <p>
                We are able to observed that East Asia & Pacific region emits the most greenhouse
                gases. East Asia & Pacific regions which is the region that is near the wester Pacific
                Ocean, countries include countries such as China, Japan, Mongolia, North Korea, 
                South Korea and Taiwan. If we refer back to the above scatterplot, we are able to 
                observe that China produces the most greenhouse gases.  
              </p>
    
              <p>
                The Sub-Saharan Africa produces the least amount of greenhouse gases. Sub-Saharan 
                Africa which lies at the south of Sahara, includes major countries like Algeria, 
                DR Congo, Sudan and Libya. It is observed that the greenhouse gases produces by 
                those countries are lesser than the one produced by other regions. 
              </p>
    
              <p>
                Overall, regions that produce less greenhouse gases emissions most likely have low 
                GDP per capita, which also indicates that they are a underdeveloped region in the 
                world.

                From this interactive scatterplot, it can be observed that if a region has high access to
                electricity rate, the most likely they will be subscribe to a mobile plan. 
              </p>
    
              <p>
                By using the slider provided, as the years progress, the quality of life for each region
                became better. Regions have access to more electricity and more and more people have 
                mobile cellular subscriptions. The bigger the circles in the scatterplot is, 
                the higher the GDP per capita of that specific region. 
              </p>
    
              <p>
                In year 2002, Sub-Saharan Africa have 3.58 mobile cellular subscriptions with the least
                amount of % of people have access to electricity. In year 2019, sub-saharan Africa still
                have the least amount of % of people have of people have access to electricity but the 
                number of epople with a mobile cellular subscriptions increases to 79.65. This shows that 
                the standard of living increases in the Sub-Saharan Africa. 
              </p>

              <p>
                To conclude, we are able to observe that Regions with less GDP per capita will lead to 
                low amount of people having access to electricity and having low mobile celllar subscriptions.
                However, they also contribute low amount of greenhouse gases emissions as compared to those
                regions that have high GDP per capita. GDP per capita not only improves the quality of life 
                of people but they may impact the world by producing high amount of greenhouse gases.
