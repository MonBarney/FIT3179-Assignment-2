            <span class = 'bold'>Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita</span> is an important indicator in modern world. It shows the

            From the map, countries such as Australia, Greenland, Sweden and United States are doing
            much <span class = 'positive'>better</span> than any other countries in the world. This is 
            due to them in having <span class = 'positive'>high</span> <span class = 'bold'>GDP per capita</span> as compared 
            to the other parts of the world.

                This chart shows the amount of greenhouse gases emissions from 2002 to 2019.

                that is near the wester Pacific
                Ocean, countries include countries such as China, Japan, Mongolia, North Korea, 
                South Korea and Taiwan. If we refer back to the above scatterplot, we are able to 
                observe that China produces the <span class = 'negative'>most greenhouse gases</span>.

                The <span class = "Sub-Saharan">Sub-Saharan Africa</span> produces the least amount of 
                greenhouse gases. <span class = "Sub-Saharan">Sub-Saharan Africa</span> which lies at

                Overall, regions that produce <span class = 'positive'>less greenhouse gases emissions</span>
                most likely have <span class = 'negative'>low

                From this interactive scatterplot, it can be observed that if a region has high access to
                electricity rate, the most likely they will be subscribe to a mobile plan.

              <p>
                By using the slider provided, as the years progress, the quality of life for each region
                became <span class = 'positive'>better</span>. Regions have access to more electricity and more and more people have 
                mobile cellular subscriptions. The bigger the circles in the scatterplot is, 
                the higher the <span class = 'bold'>GDP per capita</span>  of that specific region. 
              </p>
    
              <p>
                In year 2002, <span class = 'Sub-Saharan'>Sub-Saharan Africa</span> have 3.58 mobile cellular subscriptions with the least
                amount of % of people have access to electricity. In year 2019, <span class = 'Sub-Saharan'>sub-saharan Africa</span> still
                have the <span class = 'negative'>least</span> amount of % of people have of people have access to electricity but the 
                number of people with a mobile cellular subscriptions increases to 79.65 per 100 people. This shows that 
                the standard of living <span class = 'positive'>increases</span> in the <span class = 'Sub-Saharan'>Sub-Saharan Africa</span>. 
              </p>

              <p>
                To conclude, Regions with <span class = 'negative'>less</span> <span class = 'bold'>GDP per capita</span>  will lead to 
                low amount of people having access to electricity and having low mobile celllar subscriptions.
                However, they also contribute low amount of greenhouse gases emissions as compared to those
                regions that have <span class = 'positive'>high</span> <span class = 'bold'>GDP per capita</span> . <span class = 'bold'>GDP per capita</span> 
                 not only improves the quality of life 
                of people but they may impact the world by producing <span class = 'negative'>high amount of greenhouse gases</span>.
